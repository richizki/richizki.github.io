## Project Overview

Reactfolio is a customizable portfolio template designed for developers looking to showcase their work with style and simplicity. The project has two main branches:

- **docker-deploy**: **(Deprecated)** Docker support is no longer provided from version `v1.8.0` onwards. For users who still wish to use Docker, please refer to the [docker-deploy branch documentation](https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio/tree/docker-deploy?tab=readme-ov-file) for detailed instructions.
