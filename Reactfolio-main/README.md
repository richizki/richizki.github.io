# Reactfolio

**Reactfolio** is a customizable portfolio template built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. This template allows you to easily create your own developer portfolio for free. It is designed to be flexible and easy to modify, with all the data stored in a single [`assets.js`](https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio/blob/main/src/assets/assets.js) file.

# Quick Demo üé•

Check out the live demo of the portfolio [here](https://saqibbedar.github.io/Reactfolio/).

# Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to create and deploy your portfolio:

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository üìÇ

To begin, you should fork this repository so you have your own copy of the project.

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this page to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio.git
    ```

## Step 2: Update [`assets.js`](https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio/blob/main/src/assets/assets.js) file Data üìù

The main data for the portfolio is located in the `assets.js` file. Open it and replace the dummy data with your actual information:

Here is a basic structure of what you need to update in assets.js`

```js
// Replace dummy values with your actual information.
const AboutPage = {
  authorProfile: "Your Profile Image URL",
  authorDescription: "A short bio about yourself",
  getInTouchUrl: "Your Contact Page URL",
  authorName: "Your Name",
  profileImgTagLine: "Your Job Title or Tagline",
  authorContactMail: "Your Email Address",
  authorContactNumber: "Your Phone Number",
};

// Similarly, update other values as needed...
```

## Step 3: Update [`index.html`](https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio/blob/main/index.html) for SEO Optimization üîç

To improve the SEO of your portfolio, update the `index.html` file with your specific information. Open the `index.html` file and replace the existing values with your own:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="Your Portfolio Description">
  <meta name="keywords" content="Your, Portfolio, Keywords">
  <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
  <title>Your Portfolio Title</title>

  <!-- Similarly, update other values as needed -->

</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>

```

## Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub üöÄ

Once you‚Äôve updated the `index.html` file, you can push your changes to your GitHub repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Customize portfolio"
git push origin main
```
